    <h2 class="b">JAIPUR</h2>
Founded in AD 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan is popularly known as the Pink City. With broad avenues and spacious gardens, the city is steeped in history and culture. Here the past comes alive in magnificent forts and palaces, blushed pink, where once lived the maharajas. The bustling bazaars of Jaipur, famous for Rajasthan jewellery, fabric and shoes, possess a timeless quality and are a treasure-trove for the shoppers. 

Planned by Vidyadhar Bhattacharya, Jaipur holds the distinction of being the first planned city of India. Renowned globally for its coloured gems, the capital city of Rajasthan combines the allure of its ancient history with all the advantages of a metropolis. Jaipur rises up majestically against the backdrop of the forts Nahargarh, Jaigarh and Garh Ganesh Temple. The bustling modern city is one of the three corners of the golden triangle that includes Delhi, Agra and Jaipur.

The story goes that in 1876, the Prince of Wales visited India on a tour. Since the colour pink was symbolic of hospitality, Maharaja Ram Singh of Jaipur painted the entire city pink. The pink that colours the city makes for a marvellous spectacle to behold.

        <h2>Hawa Mahal</h2>
      <img src="hawa-mahal-jaipur.jpg" alt="Hawa Mahal"  style="width:100%">
      <figcaption>If you had any preconceived notions about how the buildings in Jaipur look, they probably came from Hawa Mahal (Palace of Breeze). It has all of the distinctive architectural features that appear in postcards of the city, from the salmon-pink, honeycombed facade, built to resemble the crown of Hindu god Krishna, to the geometric accents and rows of tiny windows.

        <h2>Jantar Mantar</h2>
      <img src="jantar_mantar.jpg" alt="Jantar Mantar" style="width:100%">
      <figcaption>At first glance, Jantar Mantar may look to be nothing more than a bunch of larger-than-life abstract sculptures. But this is not an art galleryâ€“it's a special collection of astronomical tools started by Rajput ruler Jai Singh II to measure the heavens nearly 300 years ago.

        <h2>City Palace</h2>

      <figcaption>
        City Palace has stood at the heart of the Old City of Jaipur for nearly three centuries, shortly after Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II decided to relocate his court from the city of Amber. Protected by huge guard walls, the fairy-tale-like structure is still the home of Jaipur's modern-day royal family, and is more extravagant and enchanting than you might imagine.
